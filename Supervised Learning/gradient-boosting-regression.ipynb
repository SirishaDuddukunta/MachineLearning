    "Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) is an **ensemble learning technique** used for predicting continuous values. It builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors made by the previous one. The final prediction is a weighted sum of all the models, which makes GBR powerful for handling complex datasets.\r\n",
